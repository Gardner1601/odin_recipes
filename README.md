This is my first project in the foundations course for The Odin Project. After completing the HTMl foundations lesson, I had to put the knowledge I gained during the lessons into practice. I built a basic website that contains a hamepage with links to three delicious recipes.

**After completing this project, I have learned:**
* How to set up an html file
* HTML boilerplate
* Basic elements and tags
* links and images
* lists
* Basics of git

**My Challenges throughout this project:**
For this project, my biggest challenge was using git. Before starting The Odin Project, I never had any exposure to git so I found it somewhat confusing.
